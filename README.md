## About The Project

MomentumMail is a minimalist, intelligent web application designed to automate email follow-ups, ensuring no conversation gets dropped. Users can connect their email account and designate specific sent emails for tracking. An AI-powered agent then monitors these emails for replies. If no response is received within a user-defined timeframe (e.g., 3, 5, or 7 days), the agent automatically sends a polite, context-aware follow-up email.

The application provides a clean, focused dashboard to visualize the status of all tracked emailsâ€”seeing which are awaiting a reply, which have been replied to, and which have had follow-ups sent. The core of the experience is a serene, uncluttered interface that removes the anxiety of manual follow-ups and empowers users to maintain momentum in their professional communications.

## Key Features

- **Automated Follow-ups:** Set a timer (e.g., 3, 5, 7 days) and let the AI agent send a follow-up if you don't get a reply.
- **Email Tracking:** Add emails to your dashboard to monitor their status.
- **Status Visualization:** See at a glance which emails are `Waiting`, have been `Replied` to, or have had a `Follow-up Sent`.
- **Minimalist Dashboard:** A clean, uncluttered interface designed for focus and clarity.
- **Client-Side First:** Fully interactive and demoable experience running entirely in the browser for the initial phase.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) package manager

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/momentum-mail.git
    cd momentum-mail
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.dev.vars` file in the root of the project for local development. This file is used by Wrangler to load environment variables.
    ```ini
    # .dev.vars

    # Cloudflare AI Gateway URL
    CF_AI_BASE_URL="https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/YOUR_GATEWAY_ID/openai"

    # Cloudflare AI Gateway API Key
    CF_AI_API_KEY="your-cloudflare-api-key"
    ```
    *Note: While Phase 1 is frontend-only, setting up these variables is good practice for future phases.*

## Development

To start the local development server, which includes the Vite frontend and the Cloudflare Worker backend, run:

```sh
bun run dev
```

This will start the application, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. The frontend will hot-reload on changes, providing a seamless development experience.

## Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed on the Cloudflare network.

1.  **Login to Cloudflare:**
    If you haven't already, authenticate with your Cloudflare account.
    ```sh
    bunx wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Configure Production Secrets:**
    For a production deployment, you must set your environment variables as secrets in your Cloudflare dashboard or via the command line.
    ```sh
    bunx wrangler secret put CF_AI_BASE_URL
    bunx wrangler secret put CF_AI_API_KEY
    ```

3.  **Deploy the application:**
    Run the deploy script to build the application and deploy it to your Cloudflare account.
    ```sh
    bun run deploy
    ```

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository with a single click.
